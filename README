Bitcast - A unidirectional, authenticated, resilient file transfer system

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The era of a free internet is ending.  In the near future, it may be
far harder to share files and information over the public internet.  The
community needs to consider alternative methods of distributing
information.

This project attempts to create a one-way file distribution protocol
similar in concept to bittorrent.  Its goal is to use inexpensive
hardware (wifi).  The project's goals include:

  - One-way communication.  No response needed from clients, ever.
  - Files broken into 1KB chunks and encapsulated in UDP
  - Each packet will contain a digital signature to verify that the
    packet was sent by the intended sender.  Receiving stations have
    the option of verifying this with a public key or blindly trusting
    packets in the event a public key is not available.
  - Support for file size up to 4TB
  - Support for file names up to 255 characters
